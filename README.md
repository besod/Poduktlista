# Produktlista
This console app will continuously prompt the user for input in the format "name-number", and will split the input on the hyphen character. It will then check if the second part is valid number between 200 and 500, and add the product to the list if it is. If the input is not in the correct format, it will display an error message and continue to the next iteration of the loop. 
'Product' class represents a product, and 'ProductList' class stores a linked list of products. 
Products are added by calling the 'add' method.
When the user enters 'exit', the program will sort the products alphabetically by name and display the list of products.
